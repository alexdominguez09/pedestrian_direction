# Pedestrian Movement Direction Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks
This software helps you to generate the dataset used in the publishe paper: "Pedestrian Movement Direction Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks"

This program extract and saves images from a given video.
The extracted are pedestrian moving to right, left or front.
It is based in HOG to detect a pedestrian, and optical flow to detect the pedestrian is moving.
It then saves all or some of the images in the process.
This code assumes it has opencv 2.4 installed.
